# PolylexFLE

PolylexFLE is a database containing mainly French verbal MWEs, partially annotated with CEFR levels (A1 to C2). The CEFR level annotation is partially done manually, based on Beacco reference vocabularies, and automatically, by taking into account parameters such as MWE frequencies in a CEFR corpus.
This resource is build on the basis of Lexique-Grammaire tables (http://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/DonneesLinguistiques/Lexiques-Grammaires/Visualisation.html)
